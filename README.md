## ⚠️ This project is in maintenance mode!
 Skip to the end for a TLDR.

Over the years I've started using Telegram less and less as most of the stuff I do is based on Discord.

Everytime i open TeleBridge's source i end up closing it without doing anything due to procrastination and the bad code I've written years ago weighting on me.

While you most likely can't expect new features after this warning, I can assure you that I'll continue supporting this project via bug fixes and such when needed.

I've considered making a full rewrite of the bridge, I in fact already made a base for it (without any features) over a year ago and if I ever decide to continue here's what you should expect:
- All current features of TeleBridge
- Migration to a SQL database (most likely sqlite as i find it the most suitable for this project
- Topics support/supporting new Telegram features

Goodbye (for now!), if you happen to find a bug in the current version of TeleBridge make sure to open an issue and I'll try to get on it as soon as I can!

Thank you for choosing TeleBridge ❤️

**TLDR**: This project won't get any feature updates, however I'll continue to push bugfixes and such when needed. If TeleBridge ever fully comes back, it will be a complete rewrite.

# TeleBridge
A Telegram-Discord bridge with support to multiple bridges!

![TeleBridge Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeleBridge/.github/13b4764fbf73812d2342dde0063ce85cb69cc0d7/files/GitHub_Preview.png)

Do you want to try the bot before self-hosting it? [Join my Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NKdSrmky6b) and/or [the TeleBridge test group](https://t.me/+FxQGfeA-C2hmYjA8) on Telegram

## Requirements
- MongoDB Database (Atlas is fine but idk if there are ratelimits, selfhost ftw)
- Latest NodeJS version (18.16.0+)
- Git, if you don't have it installed you might get issues while installing npm packages

## Support/Help

Do you need some help to run the bot? [Join my Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NKdSrmky6b) and go to the `telebridge-support` channel, I'll be happy to help you!

## How to host
### You should install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to continue
- Clone the repo using git or any version control program
- Create a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the Message Content intent enabled and a Telegram bot by messaging [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), **MAKE SURE TO DISABLE PRIVACY MODE** by following this example


![GIF that uses the /setprivacy command of Telegram's BotFather bot to disable the privacy on the bot](https://github.com/TeleBridge/TeleBridge/assets/64664639/525149bc-6dab-4cb7-a80a-2c7d6ac9c3a8)


- Message content **HAS** to be enabled on your bot or else it will crash, go into the Discord developer dashboard, open your application, go to bot, flip the message content intent switch on and press save on the bottom of the page

![Message Content switch in the Discord Developers dashboard](https://cdn.antogamer.it/r/msedge_02pF29B5Bz.png)

- Get the Telegram chat id by running the /chatinfo command of the bot and the Discord channel id by enabling developer mode on Discord, right clicking on the channel and clicking "Copy Channel ID"
- Fill out the [.env.example](https://github.com/AntogamerYT/TeleBridge/blob/master/.env.example) and rename it into `.env`

    Don't know how to get API_ID and API_HASH? Check [Getting API ID and hash](https://github.com/TeleBridge/TeleBridge/tree/master#getting-api-id-and-hash)
- Also fill the [example.config.json](https://github.com/AntogamerYT/TeleBridge/blob/master/example.config.json) and rename it into `config.json`

    PRO Tip: You can add more bridges by simply adding more objects in `bridges`
- Run `npm install` to install the required packages
- Use the `npm run telebridge` ( or `npm run build`, then `npm start`) and, if everything was done correctly, the bot will be up and ready to use!

If you're on Debian or any Linux distro and you get an outdated NodeJS version, I recommend using NodeSource's [repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to install a supported NodeJS version.

## Getting API ID and hash

This is required for getting MTPROTO to work for stuff like the Message Delete event (experimental, might not work), remove the variables entirely from the .env to disable MTPROTO

- Go to https://my.telegram.org/ and log in.
- After logging in, click on API Development tools as shown in the image below or simply go to https://my.telegram.org/apps and fill out the form

![my.telegram.org main page](https://github.com/TeleBridge/TeleBridge/assets/64664639/7733b339-717c-4061-bfdb-7f49502165d8)

- After filling it, you will get your api_id and api_hash parameters as shown in the image below

![api_id and api_hash](https://github.com/TeleBridge/TeleBridge/assets/64664639/fa4e91f4-7d5b-4408-804d-a14017d968e8)

## Discord commands

Slash commands:

slash commands get added everytime the bot starts

Prefix commands:

The prefix is `!` and you can't change it for now

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
